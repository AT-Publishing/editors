<blockquote>If you think u can jump from /r/bitfinex to /r/bitstamp or /r/kraken without problems in a short amount of time you are mistaken.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">You need to build up your profile on the exchange so when you move a decent amount of money it wont get blocked, you cant simply open a kraken account do the aml kyc bullshit and move over 10 000 USD for them and any exchange you are a "newborn" they know nothing about you and you plan to move a "large" amount of money just like that, start whit less than 1k per week and less that 3000 per month and have a gradual increase over time and maybe after 4-5 months you can move 10k in a transfer without problems</span></blockquote>

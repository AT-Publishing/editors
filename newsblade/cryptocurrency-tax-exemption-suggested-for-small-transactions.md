> A solution may be on the way [...] in the form of a bipartisan bill introduced in the House of Representatives on Thursday by Rep. Jared Polis (D-Co) and Rep. David Schweikert (R-Az). Titled "The CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act," the bill calls for Congress to create a so-called de minimus exemption for transactions under $600.

> If the bill is passed, it would subject digital currency to a similar tax regime as what currently exists for foreign currency. It would also eliminate a disincentive for people to use bitcoin (and other digital assets like Ethereum and LiteCoin) in day-to-day transactions.

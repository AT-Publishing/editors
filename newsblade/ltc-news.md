> "With the following LTC news, I think we may see a pretty intense pump in the coming 30 days:"

* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">SegWit activation occurring within 10 days</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Coinbase addition imminent</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">More Coinbase proof</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">Their version of Raiden (Lightning Network) will be out shortly</span>
* <span style="font-size: 1rem;">The LTC foundation converting their entire store of BTC over to LTC (showing they are in it for the long haul)</span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br></span>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Meant as a short term opportunity.</span>

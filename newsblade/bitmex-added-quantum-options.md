Read the product specification here:Â https://www.bitmex.com/app/seriesGuide/QTUM

Quantum is "like Ethereum but on Bitcoin blockchain" - a full article is coming soon.

* The BitMex product does not hold actual QTUM, it is a derivative
* There is 25% cap on movements to avoid manipulation
* You can get the actual coin on BTER and Yunbi. It is probably coming to Bittrex.

On Tuesday, June 13, we will be adding support for IOTA (IOT) exchange trading through IOT/USD and IOT/BTC pairs. Margin trading for IOT pairs will be enabled in the coming days as the order book develops suitable liquidity.

What is IOTA (IOT)?

IOTA is the first distributed ledger protocol that goes 'beyond blockchain' through its core invention 'Tangle'. The IOTA Tangle is a Directed Acyclic Graph which has no fees on transactions and no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network; instead, the throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; i.e., the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike typical blockchain architecture, in IOTA there is no separation of users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.

Bitfinex and IOTA

Bitfinex has followed IOTA since its earliest stages of development and supports the projectâ€™s innovative approach toward a blockless distributed ledger. We believe the underlying technology can lead to a new ecosystem of applications built upon this decentralized and self-regulating peer-to-peer network.

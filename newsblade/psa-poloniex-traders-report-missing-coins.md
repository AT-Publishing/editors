> I'm trading on Polo and just noticed that coins are disappearing from your balance once you cancel stop-order. By disappearing I mean completely vanish! You won't find those in open orders, balance, history, anywhere. I've just placed and then cancelled two stop-orders and I'm short 2 BTC (1 BTC each order) in my polo account.
As usual, Polo support has no idea what's going on and they'll repeat the same old shit, that is "Thank you for your patience" while we look into that. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up!
Edit: adding an image showing that this isn't some kind of a joke and Polo is aware of this issue. http://imgur.com/a/NT8Df

> My margin value has been screwy and I have noticed "missing" coins, but the missing value was also added to my unrealized pnl. So in net I wasn't missing anything.
I have noticed that a lot of their backend software is behaving very erratically, and I'm getting all kinds of weird errors and numbers through their API. I think this is happening because the programmers behind the scenes are under pressure to produce solutions and they're probably making changes to the code and pushnig it without doing much testing. If that's true, the risk of someone successfully hacking the exchange goes up dramatically.
I have been trading on Poloniex for a year, and it's the source of my livelihood. If you're curious how I am reacting to this: I have been withdrawing the max allowed every day for the last few days. I will continue until I am down to 20% or until Poloniex comes out and tells us what is going on behind the scenes and how many coins can be lost in the event of a hack.

> I just withdrew too. Like 10 days ago I think my balance that had to be returned from lendng disappeared. But I was not sure and tbh I am still not sure.
I do not keep records, but reading this I think it happened.

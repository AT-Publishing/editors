The next Byteball distribution to Bitcoin holders is scheduled for tommorow.

See [https://byteball.org/#dist](https://byteball.org/#dist) for more information.

If you have already participated in previous airdrops, you don't need to re-link your bitcoin addresses if there are still bitcoins in them. Type "hi" to the transition bot in your byteball client to see how many GB and GBB you will be getting.

Price of 1 GigaByte is currently sitting just below 0.2 BTC.

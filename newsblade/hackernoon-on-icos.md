### Excerpt:

**What’s the Problem?**

When ICO’s deliver 100% of the company’s expected receivables at launch, founders are incentivized to leave their project immediately thereafter

As such, these projects are increasingly resembling classical ponzis, with the losses borne by ordinary blue-collar Americans

No pretense of accuracy or responsibility for claims have led to ornate perpetual motion schemes receiving funding, at expense to humbler better-grounded offerings.

Incumbent and regulated VC models are no longer sustainable fundraising options, as the returns from ICO ponzis are starving out capital and perverting investor expectations

The common narrative amongst investors is surprisingly simple: Great fortunes were made in Bitcoin, this is your chance to get in on Bitcoin riches. And this narrative is so ingrained in the minds of investors that websites exist to strengthen and quantify the claim.

For the ICOs that have already run their course, victims will not speak out. They believe that either they themselves are fully responsible for their loss, or that they would not be able to exit their meager positions by doing so.

There is no ICO success story. Like all ponzis, ICOs are nearly guaranteed to be profitable until the time at which capital inflow has ceased. The success stories merely exist amongst the lucky, or those with insider information on when to pull out of the schemes.

**Where’s it going?**

Left unabated, ICOs will completely displace any pretense or recognition of security regulation law

Boiler rooms will continue to grow more aggressive in finding ignorant and unaware Americans to prey on

Facebook, Youtube, and other social media ads will grow more brazen with their claims, and less scrupulous with their demographic targeting

Self-help coach, Youtube, and Celebrity endorsement schemes will continue to grow into organized affinity fraud

Unrepentant and serial offenders will continue to run subsequent and larger rounds of ICO schemes

Companies completely outside the blockchain space will use the moniker “ICO/Token/blockchain”, to raise capital without the cost or liability associated with traditional securities regulation

ICO claims will grow increasingly detached from the limits of science and meaningful progress

Industry representatives will sponsor bills and advocate legislation designed to indemnify operators, and promote these practices

Santiment (SAN) deposits will begin at approximately 11am UTC on 12, July 2017. Exchange trading will start shortly after. SAN will be traded against BTC, ETH and USD. Margin trading for SAN pairs will be enabled as the order book develops suitable liquidity.

We decided to launch SAN trading because they’re building the future datafeeds for the crypto-markets. Their continued development, professionalism and partnerships marked them as up-and-coming players in cryptocurrencies’ nascent market data industry.

This is exactly the kind of innovation and service we’re looking for to professionalize the crypto-markets. By giving proper data to traders and investors crypto can mature and grow faster than ever.

Update7! 08/25/2012

The next update is August 30, and from August 31 updates will be posted daily.

To date, there is a process of transferring digital resources to an investment company.
The company is preparing the resource for launch.
As it was announced earlier, at startup users will be able to withdraw 55% of the funds.

We want to notify all users that there is a political background in closing our service and pressure from the US.


Sincerely, BTC-e team

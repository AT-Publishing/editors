"Time flies by so quickly! Just look what happened to the price of bitcoin, ethers, litecoins, etc., in the meantime. TREZOR development cannot just lag behind! Therefore, todayâ€™s update brings you several new improvements: **full support for ERC-20 tokens and initial support for Rootstock (RSK)**. Additionally, TREZOR is now ready for **SegWit on Litecoin and on Bitcoin Testnet**."

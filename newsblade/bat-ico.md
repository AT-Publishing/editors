One day is remaining to the [Basic Attention Token ICO](https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-crowdsale-overview-and-how-to-participate/)Â - mentioned in our latest newsletter.

To participate you need ETH for the investment and ETH to pay for gas - expect higher prices.

The fastest way to participate is to time your transation in Parity.

Download Parity from [parity.io](https://parity.io/parity.html) and setup your account - the blockchain synchronizes fast this way.

A tutorial on how to time the transaction [here on steemit](https://steemit.com/ethereum/@tomshwom/basic-attention-token-ico-how-to-get-in-asap).

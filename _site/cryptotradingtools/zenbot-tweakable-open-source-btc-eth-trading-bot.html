<p>There is a NodeJS bot available on GitHub - but it needs tweaking badly. You could either make a pull request or (probably better) fix the strategy and use it yourself, while the mundane work on the structure, middleware and UI was done by someone else.</p>

<p>Take a look at the commits here - https://github.com/carlos8f/zenbot/commits/master - Overfitting and BS much. However, the 4.x branch looks more hopeful.</p>

<p>Once again, don’t use it without modifications.</p>

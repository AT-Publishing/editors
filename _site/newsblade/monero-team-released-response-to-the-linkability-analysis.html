<p>Some excerpts:</p>

<p>Andrew Miller [author of the paper discussing the linkability] was named in the paper as a consultant to the Zerocoin Electric Coin Company and a board member of the ZCash Foundation. ZCash is a cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy that uses different technology than Monero. However, he downplayed his involvement in an interview about this paper.</p>

<p>The timing of the publication. This paper was released approximately an hour before the hardfork. While it is impossible to know the reason for the specific timing without an admission, we speculate that this was timed to draw as much attention to the paper as possible.</p>

<p>This paper was shared as “new research” about Monero. While the research is itself new and some of the analysis is the first time that some concerns have been quantified, these concerns themselves are not new. In sharing the paper, the authors often posted misleading claims that asserted these concerns were new.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of statements we find misleading:</strong> This image is from the CoinTelegraph interview. Based on the wording, you may think an attacker could determine with certainty which input is yours. However, in reality, the attacker can guess and be correct less than half of the time. Furthermore, even if the attacker guesses correctly, there is no way of proving this with certainty with data from the blockchain alone.</p>

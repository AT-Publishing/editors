<p>From the statement:</p>

<p>Up to now, Bitfinex has never charged users for these Tx Fees, as the amounts involved were relatively small. In the last two years, the fees for Bitcoin transactions, in particular, have significantly increased. At the time of writing, the recommended Tx Fee to have a Bitcoin transaction included in the next mined block is 420 satoshis/byte. For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 94,920 satoshis - about $2.20 at the current Bitcoin price.</p>

<p>Our users make thousands of transactions from our platform every day. The costs involved in sending all these transactions have increased to a point where we find ourselves forced to start charging our users the transaction fees.</p>

<p>On Monday, June 05, we will be updating the withdrawals interface to allow users to monitor the current Tx Fee assessed to cryptocurrency withdrawals. At any time, you may visit the fees page to monitor current the Tx Fee for withdrawals. For users of the REST API, please note the new endpoint for requesting current withdrawal fees.</p>

<p>Because withdrawals are sent to the blockchain in combined transactions for multiple withdrawals in a single transaction, we cannot provide an exact transaction cost for your specific withdrawal beforehand. The Tx Fee will be fixed and will automatically update on a periodic basis according to network activity and the associated cost to achieve reasonable transaction confirmation times.</p>

Python2 is no longer\n    supported. If you cloned the source directory, you will need to\n    run \"python3 setup.py install\" in order to install the new\n    dependencies.\n\n  * Segwit support:\n    - P2SH-segwit scripts are supported and can be used with hardware\n      wallets. To create a segwit wallet, trezor/ledger users will\n      need to provide a BIP49 derivation path.\n    - Native segwit scripts are supported with Electrum software\n      wallets, using a new type of seed. Segwit seeds have version\n      0x100. Note that the wizard will not create Segwit seeds by\n      default; users must opt-in with the segwit option.\n    - Native segwit scripts are represented using bech32 addresses,\n      following BIP173. Please note that BIP173 is still in draft\n      status, and that other wallets/websites may not support\n      it. Thus, you should keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be\n      able to receive bitcoins during the transition period. If BIP173\n      ends up being rejected or substantially modified, bech32 wallets\n      may have to be restored from seed. This will not affect funds\n      sent to bech32 addresses, and it will not affect the capacity of\n      Electrum to spend these funds.\n    - The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized using new\n      version numbers. Version numbers are user visible, with the\n      following prefixes:\n         * xpub/xprv : non-segwit wallet\n         * ypub/yprv : segwit-p2sh wallet\n         * zpub/zprv : native segwit wallet\n\n  * A new version of the Electrum protocol is required by the client\n    (version 1.1). Servers using older versions of the protocol will\n    not be visible in the GUI.\n\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"electrum-3-0-with-segwit-is-out.md","path":"newsblade/electrum-3-0-with-segwit-is-out.md","url":"/newsblade/electrum-3-0-with-segwit-is-out.html"}

The IOTA Tangle is a Directed Acyclic Graph which has no fees on transactions and no fixed limit on how many transactions can be confirmed per second in the network; instead, the throughput grows in conjunction with activity in the network; i.e., the more activity, the faster the network. Unlike typical blockchain architecture, in IOTA there is no separation of users and validators; rather, validation is an intrinsic property of using the ledger, thus avoiding centralization.\n\nBitfinex and IOTA\n\nBitfinex has followed IOTA since its earliest stages of development and supports the project’s innovative approach toward a blockless distributed ledger. We believe the underlying technology can lead to a new ecosystem of applications built upon this decentralized and self-regulating peer-to-peer network.\n\nLearn more about IOTA from www.iota.org","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"iota-trading-on-bitfinex.md","path":"newsblade/iota-trading-on-bitfinex.md","url":"/newsblade/iota-trading-on-bitfinex.html"}

The earnings are the underlying utility—the cash flow of the company,” explained Chris Burniske, a blockchain analyst at ARK Invest, who has helped to develop this metric.\n\n“Bitcoin P/E is composed of similar concepts. Instead of market cap, you have network value. That’s then divided by the underlying utility of bitcoin, which is its ability to move money. That’s bitcoin’s core utility, same as a company’s core utility is earnings.”\n\nThis metric currently gives bitcoin a ratio of roughly 50 [...]\n\n“On a stock, a P/E ratio of 50 would be pricey,” Burniske noted [...]\n\nHe added that over time, cryptocurrencies would find a “base range” for valuation on this metric, “one that lets investors know what would be reasonable to pay based on the crypto’s daily utility.”\n\nWhile high P/E ratios are often seen as sell signals for stocks, Burniske suggested that any kind of extreme reading on this metric could signal a bitcoin selloff.\n\n“This ratio drops when bitcoin is in the late stages of rallies, because investors would take profits or move their money between exchanges out of nervousness. That leads to a lot of transaction value, which makes the denominator higher. That’s why it’s important to me, from a valuation standpoint, that it isn’t high or low.”","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"modified-version-of-p-e-for-crypto.md","path":"newsblade/modified-version-of-p-e-for-crypto.md","url":"/newsblade/modified-version-of-p-e-for-crypto.html"}

ZCash is a cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy that uses different technology than Monero. However, he downplayed his involvement in an interview about this paper.\n\n...\n\nThe timing of the publication. This paper was released approximately an hour before the hardfork. While it is impossible to know the reason for the specific timing without an admission, we speculate that this was timed to draw as much attention to the paper as possible.\n\n...\n\nThis paper was shared as \"new research\" about Monero. While the research is itself new and some of the analysis is the first time that some concerns have been quantified, these concerns themselves are not new. In sharing the paper, the authors often posted misleading claims that asserted these concerns were new.\n\n...\n\n**Examples of statements we find misleading:** This image is from the CoinTelegraph interview. Based on the wording, you may think an attacker could determine with certainty which input is yours. However, in reality, the attacker can guess and be correct less than half of the time. Furthermore, even if the attacker guesses correctly, there is no way of proving this with certainty with data from the blockchain alone.\n\n![](https://getmonero.org/blog/assets/linkability-response/cointelegraph.jpg)","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"monero-team-released-response-to-the-linkability-analysis.md","path":"newsblade/monero-team-released-response-to-the-linkability-analysis.md","url":"/newsblade/monero-team-released-response-to-the-linkability-analysis.html"}

But in the wake of the complete redemption of the outstanding BFX tokens, Friedman saw an opportunity to be part of our recovery story, for which we are both enthusiastic and grateful.

We are confident that Friedman is a great match to meet our accounting needs.\n\nEngaging an auditor is just the first step. The comprehensive balance sheet audit, which will be dated June 30th, 2017, will require considerable time and resources on both sides. A third-party audit is important to all Bitfinex stakeholders, and we’re thrilled that Friedman will be helping us achieve this goal.\n\nIn connection with our engagement of Friedman and their expertise in the digital currency industry, we will be undertaking a process to optimize our financial operations and streamline internal accounting procedures as we push toward the goal of having fully audited financials (both balance sheet and operating results) in 2018. Transforming our back office and seeing that change to completion has been and will be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. We are working diligently on this project and will release summarized results of that audit as soon as it is available.","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"new-bitfinex-announcement.md","path":"newsblade/new-bitfinex-announcement.md","url":"/newsblade/new-bitfinex-announcement.html"}

By disappearing I mean completely vanish! You won't find those in open orders, balance, history, anywhere. I've just placed and then cancelled two stop-orders and I'm short 2 BTC (1 BTC each order) in my polo account.\nAs usual, Polo support has no idea what's going on and they'll repeat the same old shit, that is \"Thank you for your patience\" while we look into that. Just wanted to give you guys a heads up!\nEdit: adding an image showing that this isn't some kind of a joke and Polo is aware of this issue. http://imgur.com/a/NT8Df\n\n> My margin value has been screwy and I have noticed \"missing\" coins, but the missing value was also added to my unrealized pnl. So in net I wasn't missing anything.\nI have noticed that a lot of their backend software is behaving very erratically, and I'm getting all kinds of weird errors and numbers through their API. I think this is happening because the programmers behind the scenes are under pressure to produce solutions and they're probably making changes to the code and pushnig it without doing much testing. If that's true, the risk of someone successfully hacking the exchange goes up dramatically.\nI have been trading on Poloniex for a year, and it's the source of my livelihood. If you're curious how I am reacting to this: I have been withdrawing the max allowed every day for the last few days. I will continue until I am down to 20% or until Poloniex comes out and tells us what is going on behind the scenes and how many coins can be lost in the event of a hack.\n\n> I just withdrew too. Like 10 days ago I think my balance that had to be returned from lendng disappeared. But I was not sure and tbh I am still not sure.\nI do not keep records, but reading this I think it happened. \n\n[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6az4sx/people_trading_on_polo_read_this/)","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"psa-poloniex-traders-report-missing-coins.md","path":"newsblade/psa-poloniex-traders-report-missing-coins.md","url":"/newsblade/psa-poloniex-traders-report-missing-coins.html"}

The usual process involved sweeping the ether into a ETH/ETC splitter contract, before forwarding the ether to our hot wallet. Due to an issue when we upgraded from Geth 1.5.3 to 1.5.9, this contract failed to execute the hot wallet transfer for a few days in May. As a result, a significant sum of Ether has effectively been trapped in the splitter contract. The issue that caused this situation has since been resolved.\n\n> Technical Explanation\n\n> In order to call a function in an Ethereum contract, we need to work out its signature. For that we take the HEX form of the function name and feed it to Web3 SHA3. The Web3 SHA3 implementation requires the Hex value to be prefixed with 0x - optional until Geth 1.5.6.\n\n> Our code didn't prefix the Hex string with 0x and when we upgraded Geth from 1.5.3 to 1.5.9 on the 24th of May, the SHA3 function call failed and our sweeper process then called the contract with an invalid data payload resulting in the ETH becoming trapped.\n\n> As far as recoverability is concerned, EIP 156 (https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/156) could be amended to cover the situation where a contract holds funds and has no ability to move them.\n\n> Impact\n\n> While this issue poses a setback to QuadrigaCX, and has unfortunately eaten into our profits substantially, it will have no impact on account funding or withdrawals and will have no impact on the day to day operation of the exchange.\n\n> All withdrawals, including Ether, are being processed as per usual and client balances are unaffected.\n\n_________________________________\n\n[Redditor comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6es45d/daily_discussion_friday_june_02_2017/did5d0q/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=BitcoinMarkets): \"I wrote a buggy eth contract and now my funds are lost\" will become as common on the eth sub as \"I sent bitcoin with low fee and now my tx is stuck\" is on the bitcoin sub.","dir":"/newsblade/","name":"quadriga-loses-a-ton-of-eth-due-to-bad-contract.md","path":"newsblade/quadriga-loses-a-ton-of-eth-due-to-bad-contract.md","url":"/newsblade/quadriga-loses-a-ton-of-eth-due-to-bad-contract.html"}

<p>The release is not official yet, ETA is about two weeks.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># Release 3.0 - Uncanny Valley (not released yet)

  * The project was migrated to Python3. Python2 is no longer
    supported. If you cloned the source directory, you will need to
    run "python3 setup.py install" in order to install the new
    dependencies.

  * Segwit support:
    - P2SH-segwit scripts are supported and can be used with hardware
      wallets. To create a segwit wallet, trezor/ledger users will
      need to provide a BIP49 derivation path.
    - Native segwit scripts are supported with Electrum software
      wallets, using a new type of seed. Segwit seeds have version
      0x100. Note that the wizard will not create Segwit seeds by
      default; users must opt-in with the segwit option.
    - Native segwit scripts are represented using bech32 addresses,
      following BIP173. Please note that BIP173 is still in draft
      status, and that other wallets/websites may not support
      it. Thus, you should keep a non-segwit wallet in order to be
      able to receive bitcoins during the transition period. If BIP173
      ends up being rejected or substantially modified, bech32 wallets
      may have to be restored from seed. This will not affect funds
      sent to bech32 addresses, and it will not affect the capacity of
      Electrum to spend these funds.
    - The BIP32 master keys of segwit wallets are serialized using new
      version numbers. Version numbers are user visible, with the
      following prefixes:
         * xpub/xprv : non-segwit wallet
         * ypub/yprv : segwit-p2sh wallet
         * zpub/zprv : native segwit wallet

  * A new version of the Electrum protocol is required by the client
    (version 1.1). Servers using older versions of the protocol will
    not be visible in the GUI.

<p>Bitcoin’s “P/E ratio” looks at the digital currency’s network value—the number of outstanding bitcoins multiplied by price; this figure is currently $44.69 billion—against its daily transaction volume.</p>

<p>“The reason I call it a P/E ratio is because when I think about what a P/E signifies for equities, it is basically the function of market cap and earnings. The earnings are the underlying utility—the cash flow of the company,” explained Chris Burniske, a blockchain analyst at ARK Invest, who has helped to develop this metric.</p>

<p>“Bitcoin P/E is composed of similar concepts. Instead of market cap, you have network value. That’s then divided by the underlying utility of bitcoin, which is its ability to move money. That’s bitcoin’s core utility, same as a company’s core utility is earnings.”</p>

<p>This metric currently gives bitcoin a ratio of roughly 50 […]</p>

<p>“On a stock, a P/E ratio of 50 would be pricey,” Burniske noted […]</p>

<p>He added that over time, cryptocurrencies would find a “base range” for valuation on this metric, “one that lets investors know what would be reasonable to pay based on the crypto’s daily utility.”</p>

<p>While high P/E ratios are often seen as sell signals for stocks, Burniske suggested that any kind of extreme reading on this metric could signal a bitcoin selloff.</p>

<p>“This ratio drops when bitcoin is in the late stages of rallies, because investors would take profits or move their money between exchanges out of nervousness. That leads to a lot of transaction value, which makes the denominator higher. That’s why it’s important to me, from a valuation standpoint, that it isn’t high or low.”</p>

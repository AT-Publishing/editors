<p>If you do facebook and if you don’t mind letting facebook know about your crypto trading, there is a very active and very fast growing facebook group called Ethereum but in reality it’s just traders talk.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like reddit’s dailies but more serious and it’s also live without endlessly reloading the page, plus you don’t get suballiances and drama and closed off oldtimers in no-access rooms like on the whalepool teamspeak.</p>

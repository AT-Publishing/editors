<p>40% or $4m of LocalBitcoins volume was from China yesterday. https://anacoinda.github.io/localbitcoins/CNY.html (going parabolic!)</p>

<p>China can ban bitcoin exchanges all they want, and I’m sure they’ll come for LocalBitcoins soon enough, or ban VPNs, but until then the Chinese will switch on their afterburners to scoop up any BTC they can get their hands on.</p>

<p>Once all exchanges are banned, you just pay a bit extra for your downtown Moscow/Vancouver/Shanghai apartment and receive some complementary Bitcoin on the side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Japanese bitcoin holders will soon be able to reap virtual interest, as domestic exchange Coincheck is launching the country's first interest-paying fixed deposit accounts for the digital currency.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The Tokyo-based Coincheck will offer four plans, letting users deposit their currency for 14 days at a 1% annual interest rate, 30 days for 2%, 90 days for 3%, or a full year for 5%. So an account holder depositing 10 bitcoin ($15,956) for 90 days would earn roughly 0.07 bitcoin.</p>

<p>It is similar to having money in Bitfinex funding – but on Coincheck you have to be verified. The article says nothing about insurance or the like.</p>
